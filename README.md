Number Guessing Game 🎯

A beginner-friendly Python console game where the player guesses a randomly generated number.
This project was built to practice Python basics, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

Project Purpose

This project is part of my learning journey as a beginner Python developer.
It demonstrates:

 - Working with random numbers

 - Handling user input safely

 - Using loops and conditional logic

 - Writing clean and readable Python code

How the Game Works:

The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100

The user is asked to guess the number

The program gives feedback:

“Too high”

“Too low”

The game continues until the correct number is guessed



Example Gameplay:

Enter a number between 0 and 100: 40

Number is low!

Enter a number between 0 and 100: 70

Number is high!

Enter a number between 0 and 100: 55

Congratulations for guessing the number!

What I Learned:
 - How to use the random module

 - How to validate user input using try and except

 - How to use while loops effectively

 - How to give clear feedback to users

Future Improvements:

 - Add a limited number of attempts

 - Display the number of attempts used

 - Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)

 - Convert the game into a GUI or web app
